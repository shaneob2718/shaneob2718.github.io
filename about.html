            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                I'm Shane O'Brien, a physics graduate from the University of California, Irvine with a strong foundation in 
                data analysis, scientific computing, and statistical modeling. My primary research focus has been in 
                observational astrophysics, where I apply data science techniques (such as time-series analysis, signal 
                extraction, and Bayesian inference) to the study of planets beyond our solar system.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                I currently work with the Robertson Research Group at UC Irvine and the 
                GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) Collaboration, where I am co-leading a project in the confirmation of TOI-5916b 
                and TOI-6158b as exoplanets. This involves analyzing large datasets from space and ground-based telescopes, 
                modeling orbital dynamics, and using probabilistic programming (e.g., MCMC sampling) to validate planetary signals. The results 
                of this work will soon be published in the AAS Journals.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
            I'm now looking to pivot into a data science role where I can apply the same analytical rigor, coding skills, 
            and statistical modeling techniques I've used in astrophysics to solve real-world problems. With hands-on 
            experience in Python, Bayesian inference, and working with large datasets, I'm excited to bring a research-driven 
            mindset to data-driven industries. Iâ€™m especially interested in roles that value curiosity, creative problem-solving, 
            and a strong foundation in scientific methodology.
            </p>
